# ESP32 MQTT Weather Station
An ESP32 Weather Station that makes use of MQTT to publish to Home Assistant.

This is a project that I am working on in order of my dad who passed away. He always wanted a good weather station and the one at my house has broken so without my dad it is my job to make a new one. There are certain examples of these things online but most of them do a lot more or a lot less than I need this weather station to do.
